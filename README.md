## About

Job Hunt is a full-stack MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) application designed to assist job seekers in creating professional cover letters effortlessly. Leveraging the power of AI technology, the application generates customized cover letters within seconds.

During the development of Job Hunt, my primary focus was to enhance my skills and gain a deeper understanding of the MVC (Model-View-Controller) design pattern. By adopting this architectural pattern, I aimed to achieve a clear separation of concerns between the data models, business logic, and user interface components.

To implement the MVC pattern, I structured the backend codebase using Express.js as the web framework. Express.js allowed me to define routes, handle API requests, and manage the flow of data between the models and views. MongoDB served as the NoSQL database for storing user profiles, cover letter templates, and generated cover letters, while Mongoose provided an elegant ODM (Object Data Modeling) solution for interacting with the MongoDB database.

In addition to mastering the MVC design pattern, I also sought to expand my knowledge of various technologies and tools. The integration of Google Cloud Platform enabled me to leverage cloud-based storage for file uploads and implement authentication/authorization using Google accounts. I incorporated JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure token-based authentication, ensuring the privacy and integrity of user sessions.

Throughout the development process, I actively utilized AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) to facilitate seamless communication between the client-side and server-side API endpoints. This asynchronous approach enabled smooth data retrieval and submission, providing a responsive user experience.

By working on the Job Hunt application, I successfully strengthened my skills in building full-stack applications, deepened my understanding of the MVC design pattern, and gained hands-on experience with technologies such as Express.js, MongoDB, Mongoose, Google Cloud Platform, JWT, and AJAX. This project not only showcases my technical abilities but also demonstrates my commitment to continuous learning and growth as a software engineer.

## Technologies Used

- **Express.js**: Fast and minimalist web framework for Node.js, used to handle server-side logic, routing, and API endpoints.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database system used for storing user profiles, cover letter templates, and generated cover letters.
- **Mongoose**: ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB and Node.js, used for interacting with the MongoDB database, defining schemas, and performing database operations.
- **Google Cloud Platform**: Integrated with the backend to leverage various services offered by the Google Cloud Platform, such as cloud-based storage for file uploads and authentication/authorization using Google accounts.
- **MVC (Model-View-Controller) Design Pattern**: Design pattern used to structure and organize the backend codebase, separating concerns between data models, business logic, and views.
- **Static File Server**: Implemented to serve static files, such as HTML, CSS, and client-side JavaScript, to the frontend application.
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: Token-based authentication mechanism used for securing API endpoints and managing user sessions.
- **Google Auth Library**: Library used to integrate Google account authentication into the application, allowing users to log in using their Google credentials.
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime environment used to execute server-side JavaScript code.
- **AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML)**: Technique used for making asynchronous HTTP requests from the client-side to the server-side API endpoints.
